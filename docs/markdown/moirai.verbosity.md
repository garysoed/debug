## Verbosity enum

Verbosity levels of stringified objects.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare enum Verbosity 
```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  DEBUG | <code>2</code> | Verbose, useful for debugging. |
|  NONE | <code>0</code> | Nothing is printed out. |
|  QUIET | <code>1</code> | Just enough to identify stuff ... maybe. |

## Remarks

These levels are just integers. Those the values are specified in this enum, you can pass any numbers as you wish.

When stringifying an object, the verbosity level drops by one every time the function recursively stringifies the object's properties.

For example:

```ts
// Suppose example is stringified with verbosity = 2.
const example = {
  a: { // This will be stringified with verbosity = 1
    b: { // This will be stringified with verbosity = 0
      c: {} // This will not be stringified.
    },
    d: 2, // This will be stringified with verbosity = 1
  }
};

```
